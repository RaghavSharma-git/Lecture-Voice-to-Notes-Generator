⚙️ Installation & Setup
1️⃣ Clone Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/lecture-voice-to-notes.git
cd lecture-voice-to-notes
2️⃣ Create Virtual Environment
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
3️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
4️⃣ Install FFmpeg (Required for Whisper)

Download FFmpeg from:
https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/

Add bin folder to system PATH.

Verify:

ffmpeg -version
5️⃣ Run Application
streamlit run app.py
📊 How It Works

User uploads lecture audio

Whisper converts speech → text

Transcript is cleaned

Transformer model generates summary

Summary converted into bullet notes

MCQs generated dynamically

User interacts with quiz

🎯 Use Cases

Students who struggle with note-taking

Quick revision from long lectures

Self-assessment using generated MCQs

Educational AI experimentation

⚠️ Limitations

MCQs are rule-based (not fully semantic)

Very long audio may slow processing

Performance depends on hardware

Accuracy depends on audio quality

🔮 Future Improvements
